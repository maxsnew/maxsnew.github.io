<h1 id="call-by-push-value-a-calculus-for-effectful-functional-programming">Call-by-push-value: A Calculus for Effectful Functional Programming</h1>
<p>In this post, I want to introduce you to what is in my opinion the best calculus for studying effectful functional programming: Call-by-push-value (CBPV). CBPV was introduced by Paul-Blain Levy in <a href="https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~pbl/papers/tlca99.pdf">LNCS 1999</a> as a “subsuming paradigm” that can be used to unify call-by-value (CBV) and call-by-name (CBN) languages under a single calculus that is better behaved than either. Whether it was operational or denotational semantics, any model for CBV or CBN also gave rise to a CBPV model that was simpler to analyze. Long advocated by Levy as a great calculus for anyone studying effectful functional programming, it’s clear that it has caught on at least in the more theoretical corners of the programming languages community with researchers using it as a tool to help study cost semantics, probabilistic programming, gradual typing, effect handlers and combining effects with dependent types.</p>
<p>I often find I have a hard time getting across to my fellow researchers just what all the fuss is about. Especially because most of them have long written off CBN evaluation altogether and are perfectly content to study CBV. But, thinking of CBPV as just a way to study CBV and CBN all at once is really selling it short! CBPV is useful for so many things and from so many different perspectives.</p>
<ol>
<li>For type theorists, it’s a language that supports effects while also having full beta-eta laws for positive and negative types.</li>
<li>For categorically inclined, it relates to Moggi’s monadic metalanguage the same way that adjunctions relate to monads. Maybe we should call it “Levy’s adjunctive metalanguage”?</li>
<li>For typed functional programmers, it gives you access to well-behaved coinductive types separate from the more familiar inductive types.</li>
<li>For language implementers, it provides an alternative to A-normal form/Monadic form/CPS with a nice type system that helps reason about stack layout, purity and strictness.</li>
<li>For language meta-theorists, it has a simple to analyze operational semantics like CPS and its value-stack dichotomy is directly applicable to biorthogonal logical relations.</li>
</ol>
<p>All of these things make CBPV an ideal calculus to serve as the target of elaboration passes for whatever your preferred surface language is. But of course, I don’t expect you to just take my word for it! In future posts I want to dive into to some of the specific use-cases of CBPV and synthesize some of the ideas that that are spread out across many papers into some more introductory notes. In the remainder of this post I want to get across some CBPV basics: syntax, typing and operational semantics.</p>
<h2 id="overview-of-syntax-and-operational-semantics">Overview of Syntax and Operational Semantics</h2>
<p>First, to head off a potential confusion: call-by-push-value, despite its name, is <strong>not</strong> an evaluation order for lambda calculus. It is a calculus with different syntax from the lambda calculus in which call-by-value and call-by-name evaluation orders can be faithfully encoded.</p>
<p>There’s two kinds of types in CBPV: value types (which classify the structure of data) and computation types (which classify behaviors). For the basic “simply typed” version of CBPV, the following types will do well:</p>
\[\begin{align}
\text{value types } A &::=  1 \alt A \times A \alt 0 \alt A + A \alt \U \u B\\
\text{computation types }\u B &::= A \to \u B \alt \u B_1 \with \u B_2 \alt \top \alt \F A\\
\text{values} V & ::= () \alt (V,V) \alt \sigma_1 V \alt \sigma_2 V \alt \{ M \}\\
\text{computations} M & ::= \lambda x:A. M \alt \text{match\&}
\text{stacks} S & ::= \bullet \alt S\,V \alt S .\pi_i \alt x \leftarrow S; M
\end{align}\]

<p>To explain what these mean I’ll invoke Levy’s famous words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A value is, a computation does.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So to understand value types, we say what a value of the type <strong>is</strong> and to understand computation types, we say what a computation of that type <strong>does</strong>.</p>
<p>The first few value types should be familiar. A value of the unit type <span class="math inline">1</span> is a nullary tuple <span class="math inline">()</span>. A value of the <strong>strict</strong> pair type <span class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub>1</sub> × <em>A</em><sub>2</sub></span> is a pair of a value of type <span class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub>1</sub></span> and a value of type <span class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub>2</sub></span>. There are no values of the empty type 0, and a value of the sum type <span class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>A</em><sub>2</sub></span> is either an <span class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub>1</sub></span> value with a tag <span class="math inline"><em>σ</em><sub>1</sub></span> or an <span class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub>2</sub></span> value with a tag <span class="math inline"><em>σ</em><sub>2</sub></span>. The last value type is the type of “thunked” computations. Levy writes this as <span class="math inline"><em>U</em></span> but I’ll call it Thunk to be a little more accessible, at the expense of verbosity.</p>
<p>The computation types are a little stranger. First, the function type has interesting kinding: the domain of the function type is a value type, the codomain is a computation type and the function type itself is a computation type.</p>
<p>There are three kinds of terms in CBPV: values, computations, and stacks.</p>
<h2 id="what-have-we-gained">What Have We Gained?</h2>
<p>So it looks like CBPV is a quite explicit calculus that supports effects but you might be asking what is the point of all of this? Why not just work with CBV like [[TAPL][]] or <a href>the Redex Book</a> taught me? I plan to go into that in more detail in future posts (and I’ll update this post with forward links when I do), but here’s some arguments at a high level.</p>
<p>One reason is that by introducing this new concept of a computation type, we also have the ability to <strong>abstract over</strong> computation types. This allows us to conceive of things like <strong>coinductive*/*corecursive</strong> computation types or <strong>polymorphism</strong> over computation types. This can help us design new types or give more compositional definitions of old types.</p>
<p>As I’ll talk about in a future post (and wrote about <a href="file:///docs/cbpv-stal-lola-2019.pdf">here</a> previously), CBPV computation types can also be viewed as <strong>stack</strong> types, classifying the structure of the “call stack”. Perhaps this structure can be exploited in the design of low-level or compiler intermediate languages. Additionally, given CBPV is already a nice metalanguage for CBV and CBN, could we design a type-theoretic analogue of LLVM/JVM bytecode.</p>
<p>Next, when we break down concepts like the call-by-value/call-by-name function types into simpler components of Thunk, <span class="math inline">→</span> and Produce, we also find that proofs involving them naturally decompose into parts involving each, making the ideas and proofs simpler. Furthermore, different call-by-value types like multi-argument functions, variable-arity functions or “objects” with multiple methods can also be encoded using these same type constructors, and so we can re-use their cases in proofs.</p>
<h2 id="implemented-languages-based-on-cbpv">Implemented Languages Based on CBPV</h2>
<p>If you’re lime me and you love functional programming or just trying out interesting languages, you’re probably itching to try out what programming in a language like CBPV is actually like! Andrej Bauer has a simple implementation for education purposes called <a href="http://plzoo.andrej.com/language/levy.html">levy</a> in his “PL Zoo” that is probably the best for playing with the calculus I’ve presented here. I have my own Scheme-like dynamically typed variant of CBPV called <a href="https://github.com/maxsnew/modal-scheme">Fiddle</a> that is still very experimental.</p>
<p>There aren’t really any mature languages that I know of that can be considered CBPV proper languages. Since CBPV is very explicit about evaluation order like CPS or ANF, there aren’t many surface languages that follow it exactly it. However, recently designed languages that use algebraic effects like [[Frank][]] and [[Eff][]] are heavily influenced by CBPV, though they hew more toward CBV. And, on the intermediate-language front there is an alternative core language for Haskell called <a href="https://github.com/lukemaurer/sequent-core">Sequent Core</a> that is based on sequent calculus, which is a very close relative of CBPV.</p>
<p>If you know of any others, please let me know and I’ll add them to this list!</p>
<h2 id="related-work">Related Work</h2>
<p>Like most good ideas in computer science, a lot of the ideas in CBPV have been independently discovered and pursued in related work that goes by other names. CBPV is my preferred flavor of effectful calculus, but it is closely related to things like (intuitionistic) Sequent Calculi (Also called “L calculi” or “mu-mu~”), Linear-non-linear logic, the Enriched Effect Calculus, Girard’s Ludics and surely many others.</p>
