I am a computer scientist working on the foundations of programming
languages. Currently, I am an assistant professor in CSE at the
[University of Michigan][umich], part of our [MPLSE][mplse] research
community. *I am currently recruiting new graduate students at the
University of Michigan*. If you are interested, feel free to e-mail
me to discuss.

My research utilizes mathematical techniques to help in design,
analysis and implementation of programming languages. I am recently
interested in interoperability between languages, especially in the
guises of Gradual Typing and compiler intermediate languages
supporting multiple source languages.

Prior to my current position, I completed a postdoc at Wesleyan
University with [Dan Licata][dan]. I completed my PhD at Northeastern
University in Fall 2020 [Amal Ahmed][amal].
