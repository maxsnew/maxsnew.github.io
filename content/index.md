## About Me

I am a computer scientist working on the mathematical foundations of
programming languages. I am an assistant professor in Computer Science
& Engineering at the [University of Michigan][umich], part of our
[MPLSE][mplse] research community.

My research utilizes mathematical techniques to help in design,
analysis and implementation of programming languages. I am recently
interested in interoperability between languages, especially in the
guises of Gradual Typing and compiler intermediate languages
supporting multiple source languages.

Prior to my current position, I completed a postdoc at Wesleyan
University with [Dan Licata][dan]. I completed my PhD at Northeastern
University in Fall 2020 [Amal Ahmed][amal].
