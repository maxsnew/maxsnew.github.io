Category theory is a mathematical theory of structures and
transformations. While originally developed for applications to pure
mathematics, category theory has become a useful tool for studying
logic and programming languages.

The breadth of applications and high level of abstraction can make
category theory difficult to approach for those without an extensive
math background. This course aims to introduce and motivate category
theory by focusing on applications in computer science, in particular
to logic and programming languages.

Students are expected to have familiarity with basic notions of
programming language theory such as abstract syntax, type systems and
some form of formal semantics (operational, axiomatic or
denotational). Students with a strong math background but minimal
programming language background are also welcome to enroll but the
focus of the class will be on these computer science applications.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this course, students should be able to

- give axiomatic and denotational semantics to different kinds of
  logics and programming languages
- carry out basic proofs in order theory and category theory
- learn and explore further applications of order theory and category
  theory on their own, especially in programming language research
  papers

## Evaluation

There are four components of your grade:
1. Problem Sets (70%)
2. In-class presentation of solutions (10%): we will set aside class
   time to review the solutions to problem sets
3. Scribing (10%): students will contribute notes written in LaTeX of
   the in-class lectures to share with the entire class.
4. Participation (10%): attendance and participation in lecture.

## Problem Sets

Problem Sets will be posted in a [gitlab repo][signups]. You will
submit then on Canvas as a pdf. You may include hand-drawn diagrams,
but text and equations should be typeset in LaTeX.

Problem sets will be always be due at 11:59pm on the listed due
date. Late work will not be accepted.

## Scribing

This semester will use a new curriculum without following a single
textbook. To help everyone in the class, each lecture will have an
assigned scribe who will take notes on the lecture and post a LaTeX
copy in the [gitlab repo][signups].

## Attendance

Participating in this course means attending lecture in
person. Lectures will be recorded but this is not a substitute for
attendance. Each class will have a sign-in sheet.

## Course Schedule

The following schedule of topics and homeworks is *tentative* and will
be updated throughout the semester. 

We will have two weeks of no lecture during the semester: the week of
MLK day and spring break. There will not be a homework due after
spring break but there will be after MLK week (since only one day is
an academic holiday).
