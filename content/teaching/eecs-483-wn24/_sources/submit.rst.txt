Project Management
==================

.. attention:: 

   The course projects are *challenging* and time *consuming*. They may require
   significant effort to understand the implementation details and concepts:
   **Start Early!**


Starter Code
----------------


Most of the projects in this course will come with extensive (partially
complete) skeleton code, test cases, infrastructure, etc.  We will distribute
that code using the EECS gitlab (|github|_).  You are encouraged to use git's version control and
code merge features to work with your partner collaboratively.

..
   **Accessing the project code**


   Each project has a corresponding github classroom repository.  When you click on
   the link associated with the repo, you will be asked to associate your GitHub
   username with the identifier used by the Github Classroom roster.

   .. attention::

      Your Github Classroom roster ID is your **PennKey** (i.e. the prefix
      of your email address before the ``@``).  For instance, my PennKey is ``stevez``
      and my Github ID is ``Zdancewic`` so I would link those two accounts when
      I visit the link.

..
   **Cloning the repository**

   Once you have connected to the Github classroom assignment, you should ``clone`` the
   repository.  On the repository page, look for the green "Code" button, copy the repository
   URL and then, from a terminal do::

     git clone <<URL>>

   For team projects, you can coordinate your code changes using ``git``.  The most
   important ``git`` commands you will need for this course are: ``git pull``, 
   ``git add``, ``git commit``, and ``git push``.  See the ``git`` documentation for
   more information about how to use them.
  

.. _submit:

Gradescope
----------------------------


Course projects will be submitted via |gradescope|_.

Each project will be accompanied by a ``Makefile`` that will build a (time stamped) zip file suitable for submission to gradescope. For example, in HW1, you would do::

  > make zip
  zip 'hw1-submit(2022-01-06-21:45:36).zip' hellocaml.ml studenttests.ml
  adding: hellocaml.ml (deflated 67%)
  adding: studenttests.ml (deflated 52%)

The result is a file called `hw1-submit(<TIMESTAMP>).zip`, which you should upload to |gradescope|_.
    
Project Guidelines
------------------

#. Groups:

  Teams for group projects will consist of *two* students.


#. Late Projects:

     - All projects are due at 11:59pm on the due date.
     - Projects submitted late, but within 24 hours of the deadline are subject to a 10 point penalty.
     - Projects submitted late, but between 24 and 48 hours of the deadline are subject to a 20 point penalty.
     - If you have an extremely unusual circumstance, such as a serious and extended illness, contact the course instructor for special consideration.

#. Regrade Policy:

   Regrade requests should be sent to the course staff. Only reasonable requests will be considered. The entire project or exam will be regraded. Note that this means that the score on a regraded project might decrease.

#. Submission Policy

   - Projects that do not compile will get no credit.
   - Projects that compile will receive partial credit according to the grading guidelines provided in the project description.
