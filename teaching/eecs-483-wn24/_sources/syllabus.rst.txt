In this course you are expected to follow the UM Honor Code. In particular, for individual projects and group projects, the following guidelines should be followed:

- For individual projects, you must type in and edit your own code, documentation, and any other materials submitted for grading.

- Allowing someone else to copy a file of yours, either explicitly or implicitly by leaving your code unprotected, is not allowed.

We reserve the right to report suspected violations to the Engineering
