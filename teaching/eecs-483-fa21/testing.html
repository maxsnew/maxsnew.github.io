The most
important skill in writing tests is to determine <span class="emph">what</span> to test, and then
determine <span class="emph">how</span> to test.</p><p><p>Testing a compiler is particularly nuanced: if you find what looks to be a bug,
how can you localize it?  The problem could be
</p><ul><li><p>You have misunderstood the semantics of the language you&rsquo;re trying to
compile, and so have generated incorrect code.</p></li><li><p>You have misunderstood the semantics of the language in which you&rsquo;re
writing the compiler, and so it isn&rsquo;t doing what you expect.</p></li><li><p>You have misunderstood the semantics of the target language to which
you&rsquo;re compiling, and so the generated code isn&rsquo;t doing what you expect.</p></li><li><p>You have correctly understood all the languages involved, but just made a
small mistake.</p></li><li><p>The program being compiled is itself buggy.</p></li><li><p>One of the phases of the compiler is buggy.</p></li><li><p>Several phases of the compiler are buggy, and conspire to usually work
correctly anyway.</p></li><li><p>You&rsquo;ve forgotten some invariant about some aspect of your codebase, and
therefore violated it.</p></li><li><p>You&rsquo;re compiling multiple files, and they weren&rsquo;t all compiled with the
same version of your compiler.</p></li><li><p>...</p></li></ul></p><p>Programming under this level of uncertainty is like fighting quicksand: The
more you struggle and the more things you change, the less likely it is that
you&rsquo;ll figure out the underlying problem and get unstuck.  So what to do?</p><h3>2<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Types_and_.Examples)"></a>Types and Examples</h3><p>The one thing you can absolutely rely upon is that if your Rust code compiles,
then it is type-correct: you will never misuse a value of one type as if it
were of some other type.  This means that if you can encode important
invariants about your program in the types, then the Rust compiler itself will
enforce that they are upheld.  So before you dive into hacking away, consider
the signatures of your functions <span class="emph">very</span> carefully.</p><p>Imagine you want to implement some function where you have already
identified the input and output types:
<div class="sourceCodeWrapper"><span data-label="Rust" class="sourceLangLabel"></span><div class="sourceCode"><pre data-lang="text/x-rustsrc" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="text/x-rustsrc" class="sourceCode">fn f(x1: Typ1, x2: Typ2) -&gt; Typ3 {
...
}</code></pre></div></div>
Additionally you have some specification of
what that function is supposed to compute: You must check that your
concrete implementation of that type works as specified. However
thinking about tests after you have completed the implementation is
not ideal. Since you have already written your implementation, you
will likely come up with tests that you already know will pass, rather
than tests that <span class="emph">should</span> pass. Here are some recommendations on
how to come up with effective test cases:</p><ul><li><p>Follow this workflow:
<span class="emph">Write signatures</span> &gt; <span class="emph">Write a stub panicking implementation</span> &gt; <span class="emph">Write test cases</span>. Writing a panicking implementation (all
the functions are present, but immediately <span title="Rust" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="text/x-rustsrc" class="sourceCode">panic!("NYI")</code></span> or similar) will ensure that referring to the
implementation in your test cases does not produce compiling errors. Fill
in the implementation <span class="emph">after</span> writing your test cases.</p></li><li><p>Convince yourself that the code to be tested cannot be trusted, and it&rsquo;s
up to you to find any mistakes. Often a role reversal helps: imagine the
instructor was writing code for the homework, and
you get credit for finding mistakes in the instructor&rsquo;s code! Be creative:
where might the gotchas be in the design, and how might someone else
misunderstand or mis-implement the design?</p></li><li><p>Look at each function in isolation. Think about what
behavior you expect when all inputs are <span class="emph">correct</span> and <span class="emph">as expected</span>
(if you wrote the interface be sure to document its intended behavior when you
are writing it!). Remember that a test passes if the <span class="emph">expected behavior</span>
is the same as the <span class="emph">actual behavior</span>.</p></li><li><p>Look at each function in isolation. Think about every
possibility of passing <span class="emph">correct</span> and <span class="emph">incorrect</span> parameters, and
figure out how to check for whether the function behaves as expected in each
situation.</p></li><li><p>Look at each function in isolation. Carefully read about
its objectives, including exceptional cases. Think about how you will verify
that an implementation of that function actually fulfills these objectives. How
will you reproduce exceptional cases so that you can test them?</p></li><li><p>Now think about the sequences in which various functions
might be called. Is there a &ldquo;correct&rdquo; sequence of calling them? What happens
when they are called &ldquo;out of sequence,&rdquo; and what should happen?</p></li><li><p>Remember that the best option is to catch incorrect uses of your code at
compile time, such that <span class="emph">client</span> code that incorrectly uses <span class="emph">your</span>
code will produce <span class="emph">compile-time</span> errors. This ensures that if someone uses
your code incorrectly, they cannot even compile their program. The next best
option is to flag incorrect uses at run time (e.g. using exceptions). This
ensures that client code will produce errors when it is run, because it used
your code incorrectly. The unacceptable option is to <span class="emph">hope</span> that everybody
will read your documentation (or worse, your code), understand it, and use it
accordingly&#8212;<wbr></wbr>and therefore convince yourself there&rsquo;s no need to actually put
checks in your code. Remember that if documentation is vague somebody will
misinterpret it, if functionality does not consider some specific scenario
somebody will produce it. Better your tests than the user.</p></li></ul><p>Writing tests before writing your implementation will give you insight into
what your implementation ought to do. Moreover, it will help you work through
the types that you have versus the ones you may want, and often just
understanding that structure is a big help in understanding the problem.</p><h3>3<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Testing)"></a>Testing</h3><p>Obviously, unfortunately, you often can&rsquo;t write a <span class="emph">complete</span> set of tests
for your code before you&rsquo;ve started writing your code, as the process of
implementing a design can easily bring issues to the forefront that you didn&rsquo;t
notice or anticipate.  Proper testing is an iterative process: starting from
initial examples you create an initial implementation, which might suggest
additional tests, which might cause test failures, which you need to fix, which
might suggest additional tests, etc. A successful set of test cases is one that
tests whether your implementation adheres to your design, whether your design
leaves loopholes and ambiguities that allow its incorrect usage, and whether
the behavior of your implementation can be predicted in all situations. This
set of test cases <span class="emph">should compile</span>, and upon running, <span class="emph">should pass.</span></p><p><img src="http://optimalbi.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Test-First-Comic.png"/></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">NOTE:</span> It is far better to include tests that you know to fail, rather
than comment them out or delete them.  Leave a <span title="Rust" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="text/x-rustsrc" class="sourceCode">/* FIXME */</code></span> comment next to
the failing tests, explaining what you intended the test to check for, and why
you think it&rsquo;s currently failing.  At some point you clearly had a reason for
writing the test case, and it would be a shame to lose that insight by deleting
the test!  Equally bad is commenting the test out, since it gives the
misleading impression that everything is fine and all tests pass, when there
are known problems remaining...</p><h4>3.1<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Kinds_of_tests)"></a>Kinds of tests</h4><p>There are many kinds of tests you may wish to write:</p><ul><li><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Unit tests</span> are the style of tests we&rsquo;ve written all along: they
test the smallest components of your program&#8212;<wbr></wbr>individual functions, classes,
or interfaces, for example&#8212;<wbr></wbr>and confirm that they work as expected.  Unit
tests are useful for confirming that edge cases are properly handled, that
algorithms seem to work as expected on their inputs, etc.</p><p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/unit-tests-pass-01-450.png"/></p></li><li><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Regression tests</span> are the kinds of tests you always regret not
having written sooner.  They are written as soon as you notice a bug in your
code and fix it: their purpose is to ensure that the bug can never creep back
into your program inadvertently.  Regression tests are especially useful for
compilers, since there are often so many interacting parts that it is easy to
reintroduce bugs that might have been fixed before.  Write regression tests
even for the simplest of bugs: if you were inattentive enough to make that
mistake once, you could make it again, and so could your colleagues.  Let them,
and your future self, benefit from noticing the bug now!</p><p><img src="https://checkpointech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Dont-Overlook-Your-Regression-Testing.jpg"/></p></li><li><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Integration tests</span> test larger units of functionality, or indeed
even libraries at a time.  They are trickier to write, because their inputs are
usually larger and more structured: for instance, testing that a sequence of
user inputs produces the correct sequence of outputs.  These might try sending
an entire program through your compiler and checking that its final behavior is
as expected.</p><p><img src="https://chriskottom.com/images/unit-tests-passing-no-integration-tests.jpg"/></p></li><li><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Randomized or &ldquo;fuzz&rdquo; tests</span> are designed to rapidly explore a
wider space of potential inputs than can easily be written manually.  Typically
these tests require writing the code to be tested (obviously!), the code to
randomly generate inputs, and either a secondary implementation of the code
being tested or a predicate that can confirm the proper operation of that code.
These latter two are known as <span class="emph">oracles</span>, because they never make mistakes,
but you have to interpret their results carefully.  Fuzz testing is fantastic
for checking (for example) the robustness of the error handling of your
program, to see whether it holds up without crashing even under truly odd
inputs.  Likewise, it&rsquo;s particularly good at generating
wacky-but-syntactically-valid input programs to test your compiler.  (Fuzz
testing with malicious intent is one of the tools hackers use to exploit
weaknesses in systems.)</p><p><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/random_number.png"/></p></li></ul><h4>3.2<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Where_do_tests_go_in_my_project_)"></a>Where do tests go in my project?</h4><p>We will write unit tests in the same file as the defined function, and
integration tests in a separate, dedicated <code>test.rs</code> file.</p></div></div><div id="contextindicator">&nbsp;</div></body></html>
