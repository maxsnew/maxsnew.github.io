* Announcements

Next homework will be out this weekend, another 2-week assignment.




Next week we have Fall break on Monday-Tuesday. No office hours for
me, IA/GSI will announce if they are moving theirs.




Today: more depth on Lambda Lifting, which we covered too quickly before.




























* Review of Scope

let x1 = e1,
    x2 = e2,
    x3 = e3,
    ...
in e







def f1(x11,...): e1 and
def f2(x21,...): e2 and
...
def fn(xn1,...): en in
e










let: *nested scope*: each xi is bound in e{i+1} and on and in e. Not bound in ei.

def: *mutually recursive*: each fi is bound in all of the ei and e,
the xji are only bound in ej

In both cases we disallow the x1,... or the f1,... from defining the
same name twice.









But when nesting, we allow shadowing

def f(x,..): e1
in

let z = f(...) in

def f(y,...): e2 in

f(...)

is allowed.


















* Why do we need lambda lifting?

def mult(x, y):
  def loop(i):
    if i == 0:
      0
    else:
      x + loop(i - 1)
  in
  loop(y)
in

mult(5, 3)


When we call loop, it needs to have access to at least x in each stack
frame, so whenever loop is called, we need to push not just i, but
also x.





















We can model this by a program transformation:

def mult(x, y):
  loop(x, y)
and
def loop(x, i):
 if i == 0:
   0
 else:
   x + loop(x, i - 1)
in

mult(5, 3)


You might say, why didn't we write the original this way, but note
that the programmer didn't have to worry about the fact that x was
getting captured! This is a nice convenience!














General principle:

Turn the program which has various *local* function definitions, which
might *capture* variables in their containing scope, into a program
where all functions are *lifted* to the top level as a bunch of
mutually recursive functions.












I.e., start with

let x = 7 in
def f(a,b,c):
  def g(z):
    def h(i,j,k):
      if i == a:
        g(z,b,q(k))
      else:
        17
    in
    h(i,j,q(3)))
  and
  def q(r):
    x - r
  in
  g(c * x)
in 
f(x, 14, 7)

and turn it into something flattened:

def f(x, a, b, c):
  g(c * x)
and
def g(a,b,z):
  h(a, i, j, q(x, 3))
and
def h(a, i, j, k):
  if i == a:
    g(a, z, b, (q(x, k)))
  else:
    17
and
def q(x, r):
  x - r
in
f(x, x, 14, 7)

where we have added extra arguments whereever necessary.














* How to Lambda Lift

We can break the lifting process into two stages:
1. Extend each function definition so that it takes all of its
   captured variables as arguments
2. Lift the local function definitions to the top level

I.e., for our example above:

def mult(x, y):
  def loop(i):
    if i == 0:
      0
    else:
      x + loop(i - 1)
  in
  loop(y)
in

mult(5, 3)

becomes first something like

def mult(x, y):
  def loop(x, i):
    if i == 0:
      0
    else:
      x + loop(x, i - 1)
  in
  loop(x, y)
in

mult(5, 3)




and then we lift everything to the top level

def mult(x, y):
  loop(x, y)
and
def loop(x, i):
  if i == 0:
    0
  else:
    x + loop(x, i - 1)
in

mult(5, 3)

(Easy to fuse these if we want to)






















** Variable Capture

Take each function, and add as arguments, all the variables it will
need to have in its stack frame at runtime.

Additionally, add those arguments to every function *call*.

How do we determine what variables to add
to each function?

Consider two things:
1. Correctness (most important)
2. Efficiency

-- Class discussion ---

let x = 7 in
def f(a,b,c):
  def g(z):
    def h(i,j,k):
      if i == a:
        g(z,b,q(k))
      else:
        17
    in
    h(i,j,q(3)))
  and
  def q(r):
    x - r
  in
  g(c * x)
in 
f(x, 14, 7)












def mult(x, y):
  def loop(x, y, i):
    if i == 0:
      0
    else:
      x + loop(x, y, i - 1)
  in
  loop(x, y, y)
in

mult(5, 3)





let x1 = ..
    x2 = ...
    x3 = ...
    ...
    x100 = ...
in
def mult(x, y):
  def loop(i):
    if i == 0:
      0
    else:
      x + loop(i - 1)
  in
  loop(y)
in

mult(5, 3)































Here's what I expect to hear:
1. All variables that are currently in scope?
2. All variables that occur syntactically in the body of the function?

Why is (1) correct, but wasteful?
Why is (2) wrong (but when it is correct, more efficient)?













An example of a function where we need to capture a variable that does
*not* syntactically occur in the body



def f(a,b):
    def g():
        b + h()
    and
    def h():
        a
    in
    g()
in
f(0,1)


def f(a,b):
    def g(a, b):
        b + h(a)
    and
    def h(a):
        a
    in
    g(a, b)
in
f(0,1)
















-- Example of (1) being *very* wasteful --

let x1 = ...,
    x2 = ...
    x3 = ...
    ...
    x100 = ...
in
def loop(i):
  if i == 0:
    0
  else:
    x1 + loop(i - 1)
end
loop(x2) + x100

Adds 100 variables to every stack frame!!



























-- Example of (2) being wrong --


def f(x):
  def g(a):
    a + h(a - 1)
  and
  def h(z):
      if z == 0:
        x
      else:
        g(a)
  in
  g(15)
in
...













How to improve on (2):
Classical dichotomy in compilation:
1. Try to produce the best code at every stage (fixed point algorithm
   for determining what variables are captured)
2. Produce inefficient code but implement good optimizations *later*
   (implement a general purpose "unused argument removal" optimization
   pass)










So we might have a later pass that optimizes 

def mult(x, y):
  loop(x, y, y)
and
def loop(x, y, i):
  if i == 0:
    0
  else:
    x + loop(x, y, i - 1)
in

mult(5, 3)

into what we wrote manually.


The answer (in this class) is almost always (2): for instance, the
programmer might have included unused arguments in their code that you
would want to get repaired anyway. If we are building an optimizing
compiler anyway, let the optimizer do the work.



-- Food for thought: are there settings where 1 would be more practical? --






Ok, so that's how we add in the extra arguments to the function
definitions, but we also need to add the arguments to the function
*calls*.

-- How would you implement this? --

























Regardless of how we propagate that information, there is a subtle
bug(!)

-- Challenge: come up with an example program such that the algorithm
      so far produces incorrect code --

????????  Shadowing  ???????



def f(a,b):
    def g(a,b):
      let a = 42 in
      b + h(a,b)
    and
    def h(a,b):
        a
    in
    g(a,b)
in
f(0,1)


def f(a#0,b#0):
    def g():
      let a#1 = 42 in
      b#0 + h()
    and
    def h():
        a#0
    in
    g()
in
f(0,1)
























Example:

def f(x,y,z):
  def g(a):
    a + x + y
  in
  let x = 12, y = 13 in
  g(z)
in
f(1,2,3)

becomes

def f(x,y,z):
  def g(x, y, a):
    a + x + y
  in
  let x = 12, y = 13 in  -- oh no!!!
  g(x, y, z)
in
f(1,2,3)


** Lifting

The lifting is straightforward to implement once we've done this right?

-- Challenge: come up with an example program that would break if we simply lift the functions to the top level --






























let x = ... def f(a,b,c): e1 in ... ,
    y = ... def f(i,j): e2 in ...
in ...










Shadowing is the culprit again(!)











* Our Savior: Unique Identifiers

Shadowing is completely reasonable for the source language syntax, but
there's 0 benefit to allowing it in our source program. So why don't
we get rid of it? The names of the variable itself doesn't really
matter, we can always re-write the program so that there is no
shadowing. Additionally, for function definitions, we will squash
everything into mutual recursion, so we'll have to make everything
different there.


-- Discussion: at what point should we re-name variables uniquely ? --




























How? Of course we'll use our handy tagging pass to give us some unique
ids, then we can just append them to the names.



Side benefit: once all names are uniq, you don't need to use linear
environments as your data structure, and can instead reliably use
HashMaps.
